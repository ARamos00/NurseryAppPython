"""
Logging helpers for request-scoped correlation.

Overview
--------
- Exposes a `contextvars.ContextVar` (`request_id_var`) that stores the current
  request id for the lifetime of the request (set by middleware).
- Provides `RequestIDFilter`, a `logging.Filter` that injects `request_id` onto
  every `LogRecord` so formatters using `%(request_id)s` never breakâ€”even when
  the log line originates outside an HTTP request (e.g., management commands).

Usage
-----
- Middleware (`core.middleware.RequestIDLogMiddleware`) sets the value on each
  request and also adds `X-Request-ID` to responses.
- Configure the filter on handlers in Django LOGGING settings so all logs have a
  stable correlation id. A safe dash `"-"` is used when no request id is present.
