"""
Idempotency decorator for DRF views.

This module offers `@idempotent`, a defensive decorator that de-duplicates retried
requests (e.g., network retries, client resubmissions) by persisting and replaying
the *first successful* response for a given tuple:

    (user_id, key, method, path, body_hash)

Where:
- `user_id` is the authenticated user performing the request.
- `key` is the `Idempotency-Key` header value supplied by the client.
- `method` and `path` identify the endpoint.
- `body_hash` is a SHA-256 of the raw request body (or parsed data fallback).

Operational notes
-----------------
- If the project does not define `core.IdempotencyKey`, the decorator degrades
  to a no-op and the wrapped view executes normally.
- Anonymous requests are not idempotent (skipped by design).
- On a race to insert the first row, the loser handles `IntegrityError` by loading
  and returning the stored response.
- Storage includes status code, content type, and serialized body suitable
  for reconstructing a DRF `Response`.

Security & correctness
----------------------
- Persisting the response binds it to `user_id`; another user with the same header
  will not see cross-tenant data.
- The body hash prevents accidental replays if the same key is reused with different
  payloads.

def idempotent(view_fn: Callable) -> Callable:
    """Decorator providing idempotent semantics for DRF views and viewset actions.

    Behavior:
        - If the request has an `Idempotency-Key` and the `core.IdempotencyKey`
          model exists, attempt to replay a stored response that matches:
              (user, key, method, path, body_hash).
        - Otherwise, execute the view. If execution succeeds, persist the resulting
          response atomically. On an insert race (unique constraint), load and
          return the stored row instead.

    Degradation:
        - If the model is unavailable or the user is anonymous, this decorator is
          effectively a no-op and the wrapped view executes normally.

    Concurrency:
        - Uses a single `transaction.atomic()` block for creation to ensure only
          one row wins the race. Losers look up and replay the stored response.

    Args:
        view_fn: The DRF view method or function to wrap.

    Returns:
        A wrapped view function preserving the original signature/metadata.

    Implementation notes:
        - `functools.wraps` preserves DRF attributes like `__name__` for schema.
        - We defensively propagate common DRF action attributes (e.g., `mapping`)
          to keep spectacular/router behavior intact if decorator order varies.
