"""
Concurrency helpers for optimistic locking via HTTP preconditions.

This module provides a small surface to:
- Compute a *weak* ETag from a model's `updated_at` timestamp (seconds precision).
- Enforce `If-Match` on modifying requests to prevent lost updates.

Design notes
-----------
- ETags are intentionally weak (e.g., W/"1723591234") so they remain cheap to compute
  and stable across serialization differences. They are suitable for optimistic
  concurrency, not byte-for-byte cache validation.
- `require_if_match()` *only* enforces the precondition when the client supplies the
  `If-Match` header. Enforcement of "header required for updates" can be done at the
  view/policy level (e.g., a setting like ENFORCE_IF_MATCH) without changing this
  module's behavior.

Security
--------
- Clients must echo back the ETag from a fresh GET in `If-Match` to modify a resource.
  A mismatch yields HTTP 412 Precondition Failed.
